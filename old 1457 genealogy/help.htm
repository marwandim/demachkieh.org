This website uses several methods to present information about the family history. <br /> Indexes are available to quickly locate individuals, families, places etc. <br /> The information is provided in narrative form but also as timelines, ancestor charts, diagrams (or family trees) and geographically via a map. <br /> <br /><br />There are a number of interactive features to assist you in navigating your way around these pages. <br /> <br />Click on the subheadings marked with &#39;<img class='top' src='images/arrow2.show.gif' alt=''/>&#39; below to open each section, or the large <img class='bottom' src='images/expand2.gif' alt=''/> icon above right to open up all sections below. <br /><br />

The Navigation icons are all in the top left hand corner. Hover the mouse over an icon for information on its function.<br /><br /><br /> <img class='bottom button32' src='images/home32.gif' align='middle' alt='' title=''/> If you find yourself a little lost the Home icon will take you back to the beginning.<br /><br /><br /> <img class='bottom button32' src='images/individuals32.gif' align='middle' alt='' title=''/> One way to explore is to use the Name Index which lists everyone, grouped by surname. Clicking on a person&#39;s name will bring up a page with their details.<br /><br /><br /> <img class='bottom button32' src='images/families32.gif' align='middle' alt='' title=''/> Similarly there is a Family Index.<br /><br /><br /> <img class='bottom button32' src='images/trees32.gif' align='middle' alt='' title=''/> Perhaps the easiest way to get started is with the Family Tree diagrams. The Tree icon will take you to them.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

The family tree diagrams are displayed as 'genograms' as illustrated by the example below.
<br />
<div id="svgpdf"></div>
<br />
<b>Symbols</b>
<br />
Men are represented with a square, and women usually with a circle<br /> <br />A cross through the symbol indicates the individual is deceased<br /> <br />If the year of birth and death are known the age at death will be shown in the symbol.
<br />
<br /><b>Conventions</b>
<br />
In a heterosexual relationship the man is placed to the left, and the woman to the right, subsequent partners of a man are drawn to the right of the previous partner <br /> and subsequent partners for a woman are drawn to the left of the previous partner. In this way, a spouse is always be closer to his/her first partner, then the second partner (if any),<br /> third partner, and so on.In the case of ambiguity, assume a male-female relationship, rather than male-male or female-female relationship <br /> <br />The eldest child is placed on the far left of the parents relationship line, with younger siblings being drawn sequentially to the right <br />For further examples and information see also <a href='http://www.genopro.com/genogram/' target='_blank'>&#39;Introduction to the Genogram&#39;</a>
<br/>
<br/><b>Navigating the Tree</b>
<br/>
The family tree may have been split into several diagrams, or &#39;sub-trees&#39;, to make it easier to view. The diagrams may be available in two different formats.<br /> The PDF format is best for printing or in a browser without an SVG viewer option. The SVG format is interactive. Where both formats are available a button icon is provided for switching between the formats.<br /><br /><br /> When using the interactive SVG format, you can click on a person&#39;s gender symbol and it will bring up a page with their details. Clicking on a relationship line will bring up a page with that family&#39;s details. <br /> People whose names are highlighted in blue are the links between the different diagrams - you can click on their name to navigate to the next diagram..

<a name='Individuals_Page'></a><h4 class='xT-i inline'>An Individual's Page</h4><ul class='xT-h'><li>
<a name='ind00001'></a><div class='clearleft'></div>
Each individual in the report has their own page. On a person&#39;s page you will find the known details of their parents, grandparents and siblings, with hyperlnks to each, as well as pictures and any relationships.<br /> It may also list the occupations of the individual, e.g. as recorded on census returns and other documents, as well as places of residence and educational records, timelines and ancestor charts.&nbsp;

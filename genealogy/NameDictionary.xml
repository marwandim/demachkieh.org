	The purpose of this file is to translate names into alternate case forms or their equivalent in a foreign language.
	The rationale is to use a dictionary of names and perform a name lookup as the report is being generated.  

	The 'N' XML element has the syntax:

		<N lang="value" lang_B="value" lang_P="value" lang_L="value" />

	where 'lang' is a language code e.g. EN, FR, JA, DE, ES etc.,
		the language code may be prefixed with a noun type followed by a full stop to indicate a Place (P.) or Occupation (O.) 
		if no prefix is present then the noun is assumed to be an individual's name i.e. first name, last name etc.

	All attributes are optional and can occur once for each 'lang' value but at least one 'lang' attribute should be present

	Attribute 'lang' gives the Proper Noun in the language indicated by the code.

	Attribute lang_P gives possessive form (Individual Names only), lang_L gives 'locative' form (Places only).
	if locative form includes a preposition/prefix or postposition/suffix then the noun must be enclosed in square brackets []
	and the bracketed text will appear as the hyperlink (see FR_L & EN_L in sample elements below
	The noun 'possessive' and/or 'locative' case forms are ONLY required for EXCEPTIONAL cases where these forms cannot be
	obtained via the standard Report Generator handling i.e. conversion using 'regular expressions' in Dictionary.xml or in the
	case of the 'locative' form, Place Prefix properties and their translation via Dictionary.xml

	lang_B gives the base or root of the Noun (Individual Names only). This can be used to group and index the various forms of similar surnames.

	N.B. At GenoPro version 2.0.0.5 foreign language translation and base/root forms are not used in the Narrative Report.

	Usage:
		Set oNameDictionary = Util.NewNameDictionary
		oNameDictionary.BuildLookupTable "NameDictionary.xml", "EN", "JA"
		strName = oNameDictionary("Daniel")	' Should return the Japanese name

		Set oNameDicPossessive = Util.NewNameDictionary
		oNameDicPossessive.BuildLookupTable "NameDictionary.xml", "EN", "EN_P"
		strPossessiveName = oNameDicPossessive("Daniel")	' Should return Daniel's

							<h3>Allama Sheikh Hasan Demachkieh</h3>
							<p>
								His name and lineage:<br>
								Sheikh Hasan was the son of Hasan son of Abdul Majeed son of Omar son of Mustafa son of Abdul Razzaq son of Sheikh Ahmad Demachkieh. Sheikh Ahmed Demachkieh's great-grandfather was born in Damascus, but his family originally was from Al-Medina. His family migrated from Medina to Damascus during the Tamerlane's siege of Damascus. They sought refuge from the people of Damascus. Then Sheikh Ahmad and his family migrated later to Beirut, in the eleventh Hijreh century AH, and settled there. Sheikh Ahmad was the imam of Masjid Al Omari for about 70 years until his death.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br>Birth and upbringing:<br>
								Sheikh Hasan, may his soul rest in peace, was born in the city of Beirut in (1337 AH / 1918 BC), for a highly regarded family in Beirut. His father had died while his mother was pregnant with him. He grew up an orphan under his grandfather's care. Suffering from illness, he lost his vision at the age of two. His family was very saddened by his sickness, but God had compensated his sickness with an insightful, bright and powerful memory. He started memorizing the Book of Allah in the first stages of childhood and had shown remarkable traits of intelligence.
							</p>
							<p>	 
								<br>His thirst for knowledge:<br>
								Sheikh Hasan began seeking knowledge at a very young age. He began his journey with the recital of the Holy Quran. He was especially well informed about the doctrines of Imam Al Shafii. After that phase, he studied about the Islamic doctrines – Islamic jurisprudence, monotheism, the Arabic language, Qur'anic interpretations, Sunnah, Hadeeth and logic – from seniors of the field in Beirut and Damascus. During this journey of knowledge, he read about the Sunnah and Hadeeth.
							</p>
							<p>	<br>His mentors and instructors:<br>
								Sheik Hasan was educated by highly regarded and knowledgeable individuals. He attempted to memorize the Qur'an since he was 6 years old and memorized it all by the age of 13 under the guidance and supervision of Hajj Yousef Soubra. Sheikh Hasan learned about grammar and syntax from Sheikh Khalil Al Katerji who was an Imam for Masjid Al Omari Al Kabir at that time. From Sheikh Mohammad Al Arabi Al Azouzi Al Idrisi, Sheikh Hasan learned about history, famous people and the Hadeeth. Sheikh Ahmed Mukhtar Al Alayli, secretary of Fatwa, taught him about monotheism, rhetoric and interpretation. In Damascus, Sheikh Hasan learned about al shatibiyya and al durra from Sheikh Mohammad Salim Al Halwani. After this immense educational journey, Sheikh Hasan was dubbed the Sheikh of Readers in Lebanon.
								
							</p>
							<p>	
								<br>A Glimpse of Sheikh Hasan's Life:<br>
								After his enlightening journey to Damascus and Aleppo, Sheikh Hasan returned to Beirut to educate youngsters and individuals there. For a span of 18 years at the Azhar in Beirut, he taught people about several religious teachings: readings and interpretations of the Qur'an, Hadeeth, and rhetoric. He also taught the Qur'an, Hadeeth, jurisprudence and monotheism at the Union for the Conservation of the Holy Qur'an for 6 years. He lectured at different mosques in Beirut and tutored students and important figures. When he retired, he continued to tutor at his home. Sheikh Hasan was endowed with a great memory that he could remember all the details, page numbers and even sections of different hadeeths and Qur'anic verses. At times, when he sat with his pupils, he would ask them whether they felt the presence of greatest Islamic mentors; he was indeed very spiritual.

							</p>
							<h3>Arslan or Ruslan bin Abdul Qader Bin Abdul Razak Sheikh Ahmed bin Demachkieh</h3>
								
							<p>
								Arslan Demashkieh assumed the presidency of Beirut during the Ottoman rule. He was also one of the founders of Makassed Charitable association and the Sanayii School that later became the Government Palace and Law School.						
							</p>

							<h3>Badr son of Arslan or Ruslan son of Abdul Qader Son of Abdul Razak son of Sheikh Ahmed Demachkieh</h3>
							<p>
								Badr was elected in 1922 as mayor of Beirut. He made the utmost effort to secure the services of the beloved people of his city. During his reign, Manara, Cornishe and Hamra Streets were renovated. He established an industrial factory in Ruwaysat Sawfar and was elected as the first president of the industrial committee in Lebanon.

								<br>The following is an excerpt from a newspaper article (12/10/1993) describing Badr as an "exceptional man endowed with farsightedness. His establishment of the Sawfar industrial company is a proof of his hard work and commitment. He managed to bring success to the company despite the losses and troubles they faced."

								<br>His love for his country and faith in its potentials pushed him to activate tourism in Lebanon; collaborating with his colleagues Emile Edde, Najib Abu Sawan, Sheikh Amin Gemayel, Dr Fouad Ghosn and Eldona Maria Sarsaq, they created the "Society for Promoting Tourism" and he was among the first who demanded the existence of Ministry of Tourism in Lebanon. Not only was he interested in marketing for his country, but also in beautifying his country and making it greener. He was one of the founders of the Trees' Friends' Association and was the president for that association until his death in 1952.

								<br>In July 23rd 1942, Badr founded the Dimashkie Family Association that is still active today headed by Hisham Mahmoud Dimashkie. Based on Badr's request, the Dimashkie family tree was drawn by artist Sami Muhammad Ali Alkalaa in 1951.

								<br>We cannot talk about Badr Dimashkie without mentioning his wife, Julia Jiryis Tohme. As a young girl, Julia did not suffice with the education offered in her town, Mukhtara, and went to Sidon and then Choueifat to complete her studies with honors at the age of 18. After graduating from school, she taught at several schools including the Shafa Amro School in Palestine, Brummana School, and few schools in Beirut.

								<br>Julia was an active young girl who sought to promote women's rights and voices. She lectured and gave several speeches at different occasions and locations asking for women's rights. Her elegant speeches made her quite famous amongst the academic and social circles in Lebanon.

								<br>In 1910, while she was walking on Bliss Street, a horse kicked Julia causing bruises and sprains in her hands and back. Mr. Ali Salam, the father's adolescent who was riding the horse, was concerned about Julia and checked upon her health regularly at the hospital. These checkups familiarized Mr. Salam – who was president of Makassed Organization back then – with Miss Julia's dynamic personality, skillful intelligence and impressive educational background. He offered Miss Julia the position of principal at the Makassed Girls' School. This offering was spectacular for several reasons: 1. The school was the first official school for Girls in Lebanon 2. Miss Julia was a Christian lady who supervised an Islamic School. This combination resulted in creating an unprecedented Girls' School.

								<br>In 1913, Julia married Badr Dimashkie, an acquaintance of Ali Salam. They lived in Bliss Street, Beirut, with Badr's children from a former marriage (Ihsan, Baheira, and Samya) and got Salwa (1914) and Nadeem Dimashkie (1919). Julia and Badr's house served as a convention center for the educated elite of Lebanon. Both Julia and Badr called for nationalism and supported the National Party. They celebrated the Arabic language and arts associated with the Arabic culture. After their marriage, Julia still focused on her call for women's rights and she established the "Ladies' Organization" that called for liberating women and empowering them. The Organization expanded beyond its initial cause and became involved with talks about problematic social epidemics. These talks encouraged Julia to launch a women's magazine named "The New Woman". First published in 1921, the magazine became a famous best-selling magazine throughout the Arab world for 5 years. Constantly supported by her husband, Julia was encouraged to launch other magazines entitled "Young Samir" (a weekly magazine that deals with issues concerning kids) and "Nadeem" (a magazine concerned with literary discussions). These works familiarized the world with Julia's rich education and, accordingly, she was invited to represent the Lebanese Woman on several regional, Arabic, and national conferences.

								<br>In 1935, Julia's health deteriorated due to back pain and, thus, she had to stay at home often. Despite this ailment, Julia and Badr's home remained a gathering place for the educated minds. In 1947, Julia was honored with Cedar's Medal for her unprecedented efforts in serving her country.

								<br>In his book "Les Arabes D'hier", Jack Braque wrote the following: "Mais , à Beyrouth, il trouve un Liban intensement receptive, Julia Ta’mé, femme du chef de la municipalité, un Dimachqiyé, favorise le movement feministe. Elle dirige même une revue, “ La Femme nouvelle.” (p.163).

								<br>And in the "Arab World" Magazine (May, 1958), they wrote the following of her: "Julia Toumeh Dimeshkie was a rebel at heart, a rebel against tyranny of any kind. Julia was born a teacher whether in the written or spoken word. Her excellent magazine, “Al Marat al Jadeeda” , (The new woman) contained a treasury of informative, challenging and inspiring material.

								<br>No wonder the magazine was popular in Baghdad , Cairo, Jerusalem and Damascus as well as in Beirut. It had in it a touch of genius. Julia was a person of genius and a beautiful one."

							<p>
							  	Salwa is the daughter of Badr and Julia. She got married to Fouad Al Saeed. She was quite passionate about art, heritage and 	folklore. She headed the committee for Baalbak festivals and the Arab Folklore association. She was also a member of the Board of Trustees at the American University of Beirut (AUB).
